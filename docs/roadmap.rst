Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.1
===============

* API somewhat similar to the legacy evefile package, but without C++ objects shining through
* Support of monitors (including converting timestamps in position counts)
