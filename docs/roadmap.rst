Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.3
===============

* Re-add more complex data types for cameras?


For version 0.2
===============

* Re-add more complex data types for SDDs/array detectors


Todos
=====

A list of todos, extracted from the code and documentation itself, and only meant as convenience for the main developers. Ideally, this list will be empty at some point.
