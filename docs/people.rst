People behind evefile
=====================

Who are the people behind the evefile package?

The evefile package is currently developed and maintained by `Till Biskup <https://www.till-biskup.de/>`_, a scientist with a strong background in `reproducible research <https://www.reproducible-research.de/>`_, working currently at the German National Metrology Institute, the `Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) <https://www.ptb.de/>`_. His scientific background is in spectroscopy, and he actively develops a series of Python packages for the processing and analysis of spectroscopic data, most prominently the `ASpecD framework <https://docs.aspecd.de/>`_ and a series of packages derived from this package and dedicated to work with `cw-EPR <https://docs.cwepr.de>`_, `tr-EPR <https://docs.trepr.de>`_, and `UV-vis <https://docs.uvvispy.de>`_ data.

All development is performed in close collaboration with the colleagues at PTB responsible for developing and maintaining the EVE measurement program: Hartmut Scherr, Marcus Michalsky.

Furthermore, developing such a package and the underlying abstractions forming the data model is only possible in close contact with the actual domain experts, *i.e.* all the people at PTB actually operating the beamlines, obtaining the data, and finally analysing the measurements.
